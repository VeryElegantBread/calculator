The current operations you can do:

| -------------- | ---- | --------- |
| Addition       | +    | 1 + 7 = 8 |
| Subtraction    | -    | 7 - 1 = 6 |
| Multiplication | *    | 3 * 2 = 6 |
| Division       | /    | 8 / 2 = 4 |
| Modulos        | %    | 7 % 3 = 1 |
| Exponents      | ^    | 2 ^ 3 = 8 |
## Issues
- Exponents can only do whole numbers > 0
